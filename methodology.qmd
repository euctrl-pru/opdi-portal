The various methodologies used to extract **flight lists**, **flight events** and **measurements** from trajectory state vectors.

## Flight List

To construct the flight list the trajectory needs to be identified from the state vectors. In addition, one needs to assign the aerodromes of departure (`ADEP`) and destination (`ADES`). Based on the state vector source, the trajectory might already contain an identifier `id` and an `ADEP` and `ADES`. The various subsequent algorithms are considered iterative improvements.

## Flight Events

The flight events are extracted from the identified trajectories using different methods for the different `type`s of flight events.
