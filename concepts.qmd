## Phases of a Flight

In a flight we can identify _events_ that can help to monitor its evolution from a gate-to-gate
perspective.
@fig-flight-phases shows a simplified diagram of a possible set of flight phases (white square boxes) and relevant events (`Txy` labels).

![Flight phases and events.](media/flight_states.png){#fig-flight-phases width="100%"}

In general we are interested in analyzing performance at gate-to-gate level so
as to cover both the airborne and the ground phases of flights. To this extent
we summarize a flight down to some of its fundamental milestones as in the
following list (from departure to arrival):

(@) Off-block (**T06**)
(@) End of push back (**T07**)
(@) Enter runway for take-off (**T09**)
(@) Lift-off (**T12**), a.k.a. take-off
(@) 40-nautical-miles intersection (**T14** ?)
(@) top-of-climb (**T15**)
(@) top-of-descent (**T18**)
(@) 40-nautical-miles intersection (**T19** ?)
(@) Touch-down (**T22**)
(@) Runway vacated (**T24**)
(@) Enter parking spot (**T26**)
(@) on-block (**T27**)


Other interesting milestones could be

(@) Holding start
(@) Holding end
(@) Leveled segment start
(@) Leveled segment end
(@) FIR crossing


Subsets of these milestones allow for the calculation of taxi-in (`T24`, `T27`) and
taxi-out (`T06`, `T09`) times, runway utilization and
sequencing (`T12`, `T22`), inefficiencies in the \acr{TMA} (via
holding patterns and leveled portions of the descent)  ...
Additional ad-hoc milestones can be defined for specific needs, for example \acr{FIR} crossing
milestones would be usefult to count \acr{DAIO} statistics.


## Milestone {#sec-milestones}

A flight milestone is conceptually defined by

* flight ID it belongs to
* 3D location (decimal degrees of longitude, latitude [in WSG84] and altitude [in feet]), i.e.
  `17.933996,59.653410,-203`
* UTC timestamp, i.e. `2021-09-27 10:43:11.234 UTC`
* milestone type, i.e. `top-of-climb` or `off-block`

Further useful attributes for business processing of the information are:

* the source of extraction of the milestone, i.e. `apdf` (when data provided by airport),
  `osn` (extracted by \acr{OSN}'s \acr{ADS-B} data), `nm` (as calculated by EUROCONTROL's \acr{NM})
* contextual information, i.e. `F33R` as the relevant parking position for an `off-block` milestone
  or `26` as the runway ID for a `take-off` milestone.
  This field can be also useful to define a custom fomat for airspace crossing, for example for
  a milestone like `x-fir` we could have the `info` contain something like `from:LFFF, to:LFRR` to
  provide info about the transition order of airspace penetration.


## Use Cases

A milestone-based representation of a flight is a way to reduce complexity
for its representation and hence allow some (still useful) statistical analysis for
performance monitoring.


![Milestones and their use.](media/milestones-usage.png)

### Fuel consumption / Environmental emissions

Environmental emissions and climate impact are indicators more and more in news headlines and
on the political agendas.
With a milestone-based representation of a flight we can *segment* the phases of interest
and calculated the relevant cumulative emissions.

For example we can split a flight in the following phases:

* cruise
* \acr{LTO} cycle

and calculate the fuel-burnt emissions by further splitting them.

![LTO phases ([@doi/10.2822/385503] Figure 2.5).](media/lto-cycle_eea.png)

For LTO we have four sub-phases:

* approach
* taxi-in
* taxi-out
* take-off
* climb-out

For example taxi-out sub-phase can be framed by the ground portion from `off-block` to
`rwy-entry` milestones which with defined assumptions in term of aircraft & engine type,
full thrust percentage and number of engines in use can be handled to an emission calculator
to compute CO2, NOx, ... emissions.

The selection of milestones to model the flight and the further assumptions of how the aircraft
is operated between those milestones will produce results with different levels of
[accuracy and precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision).


**NOTE**: add ER diagram for use case

### Operational performance


A milestone-based modelling of a flight provides practical ways to extract operational
indicators for the analysis of the operation performance at network, state, airport or
airline level.

For example using the `touch-down` (**T22** in @fig-flight-phases) with the contextual information
we can calculate RWY utilization at each airport or inter-arrival times, etc.


### Airspace profile

**TODO**: milestones line FIR crossing (`x-fir`) could be used to extract an flight airspace profile.
For example we could have AUA crossing (`x-aua`) or even elementary airspace (`x-esa`) ones.
The tricky thing is obviously having a non-overlapping airspaces (of the same type)

## Milestones Definition

The milestone concept can be modeled in entity-relationship fashion as in @fig-er-milestones.
