Draft

To monitor performance indicators of a flight, trajectories must be broken down into discrete events represent key milestones in the flight to allow for statistical analysis. These flight events represent the location and time of occurrence of the event (e.g., a flight level crossing). In case of a longer event duration (e.g., a level segment), the start and end of this flight phase are captured in two separate events.

Any statistical performance analysis on flight data thus starts with identifying these events in flight trajectories. To promote performance analysis on publicly available flight trajectory data, the Open Performance Data Initiative constructed a flight list, a flight event table and an associated measurements table. These tables are based on ADS-B trajectory data from [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/) (OSN) and are made freely available to support open source performance analysis on publicly available data. Later releases of the data sets will include validations and corrections using data from third party sources where possible.
