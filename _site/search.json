Pursuing an open data-based approach will allow all interested parties to tap into a harmonised data environment to build their assessments, validate results published by other parties, and reproduce findings in support of the political and operational discussion about observed performance.\nThe upcoming challenges to our industry require that stakeholders can embrace and tap into a harmonised and consolidated data set to drive the discussion on higher performance levels, performance expectations in terms of targets, or realised performance benefits following the deployment of new capabilities.\nFor more information about the Open Performance Data Initiative, see here."

    "section": "Benefits of Open Access and Open Data for Performance Monitoring",
    "text": "Benefits of Open Access and Open Data for Performance Monitoring\nTo understand the depth of the proposed Open Performance Data Initiative it is vital to define the key terminology upfront.\n\nOpen Access: Open Access refers to the process of managing copyright and licensing terms and access to the data. This access mode is vital to overcome today’s limitation and remove barriers such as price (including subscriptions, licensing fees, user-pay-principles, or even view fees), and permission (e.g., licensing restrictions) to enable free access and use of the data.\nOpen Data: The term Open Data refers to data - typically managed and available online – which is free of cost and accessible data. Open data can be freely used, reused, and distributed provided that the data source is attributed.\nOpen-Source Software: Open-Source Software is software which source code can be openly accessed, inspected, modified, and enhanced by anyone.\n\nThe focus of the Open Performance Data Initiative is on open data, in particular open access and open use of data for non-commercial purposes. It is understood that potential developments of novel algorithms and techniques can produce tools that are made available to the community as open-source software.\nThere exists a huge body of literature highlighting the impact of open data. Across the different sources the following impact areas emerge:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransparency and accountability\n\n\n\n\n\nA key tenet of the performance-based approach is independent and impartial monitoring to provide the evidence for achieved performance levels and to identify and share best practice for further performance enhancements in ATM.\nHigher levels of transparency and accountability provide the foundation for a democratisation of air traffic management. Public and stakeholder access to data is also seen as a key ingredient to establish accountability. This also requires a culture change that is implicitly built into the performance-based approach. Observed levels of performance are publicly communicated and tracked. Associated performance measurement algorithms are published and the monitoring results are reproducible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInnovation, participation, and joint development\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen data from both public and private sources are adding a new dimension2 to the data revolution. It also is a key ingredient to leverage the promises of “big data”, or supporting data-analytical advances in artificial intelligence/machine-learning.\nA clear driver for innovation is the opportunity to understand how systems work, where bottlenecks emerge or certain patterns manifest. At the same time, it is important to understand the parameters and conditions for good and best-in-class performance. Sharing and access to data therefore fosters to have another view on performance by observing new developments with different priorities/ perspectives, or other organisational /institutional factors limiting the use and value creation from data, including its combination with additional data and resources.\nThe ability of public, interested researchers, policymakers/think tanks, or strategic planners to access the data and exploit it creates joint communities of interest. This may enhance the value of the data to drive joint developments ranging from data standardisation, including access and storage, but also to build on the data. The latter may range from methodological approaches, operational solutions and other tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffectiveness\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the heart of the performance-based approach is the potential to achieve higher levels of performance and associated decision-making through data-driven decision-making. This may affect day-to-day decision-making, but also longterm decision such as the need for adopting new operational concepts or deploying operational capabilities.\nOpen data goes beyond the classical – potentially limited –sharing of data in support of use-case analyses, projects or activities. It is a continual process which allows to champion and demonstrate observed performance levels. In that respect open performance data can also serve as a tool to improve communication and partnerships in terms of data sharing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngagement and Empowerment\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most direct impact of open data for engagement and empowerment is related to its transparency effects. Air transportation and air traffic management are at a crossroad. Future political goals and expected performance levels require higher levels of transparency and the existence of a data basis in support of verification and validation/reproduction of results. The transparency discussion will result from a higher pressure on the industry to demonstrate – for example – its contribution to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. There is also a discussion on the success of air navigation system modernisation (i.e., transformation) in general. This requires demonstration of operational performance benefits derived from funding and modernisation activities.\nThe need to address the societal challenges and political goals will require a wider engagement of air navigation with the public and policy level, but also facilitate such an engagement with the industry and interested public. The PRC is confident that the practice of the past to provide a platform to validate and reproduce performance observations will facilitate higher levels of engagement and empowerment with and between stakeholders and public. Open data can be a key enabler to facilitate this engagement and ensure the appropriate level of independent transparency to drive and inform the public debate, political and strategic decision-making.\n\n\n\nOpen data and performance analytics are often viewed as separate practices, however, both are inextricable when it comes to the operations of modern governance. To ensure transparent and independent review, open data provides the underlying “raw material” for the analysis and monitoring of performance. In that respect, PRC’s Open Performance Data Initiative aims at increasing transparency, supporting higher levels of data access and information availability for decision-making, engaging and increasing accountability of involved stakeholders.\nFor more information about the potential benefits of the open access and open data for performance monitoring, see here."

In these cases the EVENT concept can still be used, we can capture the start and the end of this phenomenon as two separate event types and process them as a pair during the analysis.\nThe concept of MEASUREMENT is then used when associating specific metrics to the events of interest.

A flight event or milestone is conceptually defined by\n\nThe flight trajectory id it belongs to.\nThe 3D location:\n\nlongitude and latitude (in WSG84),\naltitude (in feet), e.g., 32000 ft.\n\nThe event_time when the event took place (UTC). E.g., 2021-09-27 10:43:11.234 UTC.\nThe event type, i.e. top-of-climb or off-block.\nThe source indicates the origin of the flight trajectory used to determine the event (e.g., OSN).\nThe version indicates the algorithm version used to detect the flight event. For more info, see Methodology.\nAdditional info is captured at last. This can be contextual information, i.e. F33R as the relevant parking position for an off-block milestone or 26 as the Runway (RWY) ID for a take-off milestone.\n\nA Flight phase is a prolonged event which can be broken down into a start event and an end event of the phase. Figure 1 shows a simplified diagram of a possible set of flight phases (white square boxes) and relevant flight events (Txy labels).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Flight phases and events.\n\n\n\nThe events in Figure 1 are:\n\nT00 = time of maintenance completion\nT01 = time aircraft servicing begins\nT02 = time aircraft loading begins\nT03 = time aircraft is ready for pushback\nT04 = time off-blocks\nT05 = pushback complete - parking position vacated - start taxi\nT06 = start taxi onto take-off runway\nT07 = start take-off roll\nT08 = start rotation\nT09 = positive rate of climb established\nT10 = time aircraft reaches safety altitude and leaves traffic circuit\nT11 = time aircraft enters en-route airspace\nT12 = time of Top of Climb\nT13 = time of Top of Descent\nT14 = aircraft enters terminal airspace and starts approach\nT15 = aircraft established on final approach\nT16 = aircraft over runway threshold\nT17 = time of touchdown\nT18 = time aircraft starts turn-off\nT19 = time runway is vacated\nT20 = aircraft starts manoeuvring into parking position\nT21 = on-blocks\nT22 = time unloading begins\nT23 = unloading completed\nT24 = arrival servicing completed\nT25 = start of maintenance\n\nExamples of usage:\n\nT04–T06 = Taxi-out\nT19–T21 = Taxi-in\nT08–T17 = Airborne time\nT04–T21 = block-to-block time\nT06–T08 = Runway occupancy time (departure)\nT04–T05 = Pushback delay\nT03–T22 = Turnaround time\n\nIn general, we are interested in analyzing performance at gate-to-gate level so as to cover both the airborne and the ground phases of flights. To this extent we summarize a flight down to some of its fundamental flight events as in the following list (from departure to arrival):\n\nOff-block (T04)\nEnd of push back (T05)\nEnter runway for take-off (T06)\nLift-off (T08), a.k.a. take-off\n40-nautical-miles intersection (sort of T11)\nTop-of-climb (T12)\nTop-of-descent (T13)\n40-nautical-miles intersection (sort of T14)\nTouch-down (T17)\nRunway vacated (T19)\nEnter parking spot (T20)\nOn-block (T21)\n\nOther interesting flight events are:\n\nHolding start\nHolding end\nLeveled segment start\nLeveled segment end\nFlight Information Region (FIR) crossing\n\nThese additional ad hoc milestones can be used for specific reports, for example Flight Information Region (FIR) crossings could be useful to count Departure, Arrival, Internal, Overflight (DAIO) statistics."

    "text": "Use Cases\nAn event-based representation of a flight is a way to reduce complexity for its representation and allow statistical analysis for performance monitoring.\n\nOperational Performance Monitoring\nOne of the possible use cases for an event-based representation of a flight, could be the monitoring of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) GANP Key Performance Indicator (KPI)s. Thus operational indicators could be extracted for the analysis of the operations performance at network, state, airport or airline level.\nFor example using the touch-down (T17 in Figure 1) with the contextual information (RWY identification) we can calculate RWY utilization at each airport or inter-arrival times, etc.\n Possible monitoring usages are:\n\nAirport performance (Throughput, RWY utilization, …)\nFuel efficiency & CO2/NOx Emissions\nAirline profiling\nSafety: separation, …\nInfluence/resilience to Meteo events\n\n\n\nFuel Consumption and Environmental Emissions\nEnvironmental emissions and climate impact are indicators more and more in news headlines and on the political agendas. With a event-based representation of a flight we can segment the phases of interest and calculated the relevant cumulative emissions.\nFor example we can split a flight in the following phases:\n\nCruise\nLanding and TakeOff (LTO) cycle\n\nand calculate the fuel-burnt emissions by further splitting them.\n\n\n\nLTO phases ([1] Figure 2.5).\n\n\nFor LTO we have four sub-phases:\n\nApproach\nTaxi-in\nTaxi-out\nTake-off\nClimb-out\n\nThe taxi-out sub-phase can be framed by the ground portion from off-block to rwy-entry event which with defined assumptions in term of aircraft & engine type, full thrust percentage and number of engines in use can be handled to an emission calculator to compute CO2, NOx, … emissions.\nThe selection of flight events to model the flight and the further assumptions of how the aircraft is operated between those milestones will produce results with different levels of accuracy and precision.\n\n\nAirspace profile\nMilestones line FIR crossing (x-fir) could be used to extract a flight airspace profile. For example we could have AUA crossing (x-aua) or even elementary airspace (x-esa) ones. The tricky thing is obviously having a non-overlapping airspaces (of the same type)"

This is done to ensure uniqueness of the id.\nADEP/ADES identification algorithm(s):\nTo approximate the aerodrome of departure (ADEP) or destination (ADES) of a departing or arriving flight, coordinate grids are calculated for each airport with a radius of 10km and a latitude/longitude step of 0.0001 degrees. For each point in the circular grid surrounding the airport, the distance to the aerodrome reference point (ARP) is calculated.\nThe trajectories identified in the previous step are filtered to only retain state vectors with an altitude lower than 10,000 ft. Onto the latitude and longitude (rounded to 0.0001 degrees) of the remaining state vectors the airport coordinate grids are superimposed. Each state vector in the resulting data sets now indicates the various aerodromes the coordinates overlap with.

The last time it crosses a flight level of interest, the crossing state vector is recorded as a Last Crossing event."

The unit is nautic miles (NM). This segment distance is then summed cumulatively for each state vector since the first state vector (at time first_seen). This determined flown distance in nautic miles is then taken as measurement when identifying a flight event."
