## Future Releases

### Q1 2025

This release aims to include the following improvements:

- Inclusion of new event types and occurrences:
  * off-block
  * in-block
  * \acr{FIR} crossing

### Candidate topics for future releases

In the longer term the \acr{OPDI} aims to include the following improvements:

- Include more events
  * start and stop of holdings
- Use third party trajectory data (aside from the available via \acr{OSN}).
- Validate flight events and measurements using third party data.
- Provide easy access to \acr{OSN} state vector trajectories at 5-sec granularity
- Provide cleaned up state vector based trajectories, i.e. remove vertical glitches
  (via `filter()` in [`traffic`](https://traffic-viz.github.io/index.html) library), associate meteorological information (via
  [`fastmeteo`](https://github.com/junzis/fastmeteo) library), remove dirty trajectories (too small/short), ...
