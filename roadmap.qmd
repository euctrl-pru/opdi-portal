The plan is to release subsequent improvements of the \acr{OPDI} data sets every two months. 

## Future Releases

**Next release**

The next release (February 2024) aims to include the following improvements:

- Larger time frame for the available data sets (initial goal: 1 year).
- Improving the initial flight event extractions by fine tuning parameters and algorithms.
- Improvement in flight list \acr{ADEP} / \acr{ADES} approximations using [H3 geospatial indexing system](https://h3geo.org/).
- Inclusion of off-block, in-block, runway entry and exit flight events.

**Long term release vision**

Long term the \acr{OPDI} aims to include the following improvements:

- Include more milestones (\acr{FIR} crossing, start and stop of holdings patters).
- Use third party trajectory data (aside from the available \acr{OSN} trajectory data).
- Use third party data for validations of flight events and measurements.
- Provide easy access to \acr{OSN} state vector trajectories at 5-sec granularity
- Provide cleaned up
