The plan is to release subsequent improvements of the Open Performance Data Initiative (OPDI) data sets every two months. 

## Future Releases

**Next release**

The next release (February 2024) aims to include the following improvements:

- Larger time frame for the available data sets (initial goal: 1 year).
- Improving the initial flight event extractions by fine tuning parameters and algorithms.
- Improvement in flight list ADEP / ADES approximations using [H3 geospatial indexing system](https://h3geo.org/).
- Inclusion of off-block, in-block, runway entry and exit flight events.

**Long term release vision**

Long term the OPDI aims to include the following improvements:

- Include more milestones (FIR crossing, start and stop of holdings patters).
- Use third party trajectory data (aside from the available OpenSky Network trajectory data).
- Use third party data for validations of flight events and measurements.
