The plan is to release subsequent improvements of the \acr{OPDI} data sets every two months. 

## Future Releases

### February 2024

This release aims to include the following improvements:

- Larger time frame for the available data sets (goal: 1 year).
- Improving the initial flight event extractions by fine tuning parameters and algorithms.
- Improvement in flight list \acr{ADEP} / \acr{ADES} approximations using [H3 geospatial indexing system](https://h3geo.org/).
- Inclusion of new event types and occurrences:
  * off-block
  * in-block
  * runway entry
  * runway exit


### Candidate topics for future releases

In the longer term the \acr{OPDI} aims to include the following improvements:

- Include more events
  * \acr{FIR} crossing
  * start and stop of holdings
- Use third party trajectory data (aside from the available via \acr{OSN}).
- Validate flight events and measurements using third party data.
- Provide easy access to \acr{OSN} state vector trajectories at 5-sec granularity
- Provide cleaned up state vector based trajectories, i.e. remove vertical glitches
  (via `filter()` in [`traffic`](https://traffic-viz.github.io/index.html) library), associate meteorological information (via
  [`fastmeteo`](https://github.com/junzis/fastmeteo) library), remove dirty trajectories (too small/short), ...
